# QNN-Methane-Detetction


Quantum Neural Network for Methane Detection

This implementation follows a comprehensive approach combining quantum and classical techniques:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Loads temporal meteorological data
   - Handles missing values and outliers
   - Extracts temporal patterns and weather features
   - Normalizes data for quantum compatibility

2. Quantum Feature Encoding:
   - Uses angle encoding for quantum features
   - Maps features to rotation gates
   - Creates quantum-inspired classical features

3. Quantum Kernels:
   - Implements quantum kernel for similarity measures
   - Uses fidelity-based kernel computation
   - Handles quantum state preparation

4. QNN Architecture:
   - Combines quantum and classical components
   - Uses variational quantum circuits
   - Implements hybrid optimization

5. Evaluation:
   - Cross-validation for robustness
   - Multiple performance metrics
   - Cluster analysis for patterns
